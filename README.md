## Algorithms collection implemented in Nim - for education

Implementations are for learning purposes only. They may be less efficient than the implementations in the [Nim standard library](https://nim-lang.org/docs/lib.html) or [Nimble packages](https://nimble.directory/). Use them at your discretion.

## Getting Started

Read through our [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before you contribute.

## List of Algorithms

See our [directory](DIRECTORY.md) for easier navigation and a better overview of the project.

## Community Channels

We are on [Discord](https://the-algorithms.com/discord) and [Gitter](https://gitter.im/TheAlgorithms)/[Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#TheAlgorithms_community:gitter.im)!
Community channels are a great way for you to ask questions and get help. Please join us!
