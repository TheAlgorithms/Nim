## What is an Algorithm?

An Algorithm is one or more functions that:

- take one or more inputs,
- perform some internal calculations or data manipulations,
- return one or more outputs,
- have minimal side effects (Examples of side effects: `echo()`, `rand()`, `read()`, `write()`).

## Contributor agreement

Being one of our contributors, you agree and confirm that:

- Your work will be distributed under [MIT License](LICENSE.md) once your pull request is merged.
- Your work meets the standards of this guideline.

## Contribution guidelines

We appreciate any contribution, from fixing a grammar mistake in a comment to implementing complex algorithms. Please check the [directory](directory.md) and [issues](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Nim/issues/) for an existing (or declined) implementation of your algorithm and relevant discussions.

**New implementations** are welcome! This includes: new solutions for a problem, different representations for a data structure, algorithm design with a different complexity or features.

**Improving documentation and comments** and **adding tests** is also highly welcome.

**Identical implementations** are not allowed.

### Implementation requirements

- The unit of an implementation we expect is a [**Nim module**](https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#modules). Although the main goals of this repository are educational, the module form mirrors a real world scenario and makes it easy to use the code from this repository in other projects.
- First line must contain the canonical title of the module prefixed by double hashes (`## Title Of The Module`). This title is used in this repository's automation for populating the [Directory](directory.md).
- The module should be thoroughly documented with doc comments. Follow the [Nim documentation style](https://nim-lang.org/docs/docstyle.html).
- The file begins with the module-level documentation with the general description and explanation of the algorithm/data-structure. If possible, please include:
  * Any restrictions of the implementation and any constraints for the input data.
  * An overview of the use-cases.
  * Recommendations for when to use or avoid using it.
  * Comparison with the alternatives.
  * Links to source materials and further reading.
- Use intuitive and descriptive names for objects, functions, and variables.
- Return all calculation results instead of printing or plotting them.
- This repository is not simply a compilation of *how-to* examples for existing Nim packages and routines. Each algorithm implementation should add unique value. It is fine to leverage the standard library or third-party packages as long as it doesn't substitute writing the algorithm itself. In other words, you don't need to reimplement a basic hash table ([`std/tables`](https://nim-lang.org/docs/tables.html)) each time you need to use it, unless it is the goal of the module.
- Avoid importing third-party libraries. Only use those for complicated algorithms and only if the alternatives of relying on the standard library or including a short amount of the appropriately-licensed external code are not feasible.
- The module has to include tests that check valid and erroneous input values and the appropriate edge-cases. See [Documentation, examples and tests](#documentation-examples-and-tests) below.

### Nim Coding Style

#### Readability and naming conventions

We want your work to be readable by others; therefore, we encourage you to follow the official [Nim Coding Style](https://nim-lang.org/docs/nep1.html).

- Help your readers by using **descriptive names** that eliminate the need for redundant comments.
- Follow Nim conventions for naming: camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for types and objects, PascalCase or UPPERCASE for constants.
- Avoid single-letter variable names, unless it has a minimal lifespan. If your variable comes from a mathematical context or no confusion is possible with another variable, you may use single-letter variables. Generally, single-letter variables stop being OK if there's more than just a couple of them in a scope. Some examples:
  * Prefer `index` or `idx` to `i` for loops.
  * Prefer `src` and `dst` to `a` and `b`.
  * Prefer `remainder` to `r` and `prefix` to `p`.
- Expand acronyms. Prefer `greatestCommonDivisor()` to `gcd()`, as the former is easier to understand than the latter, especially for non-native English speakers.

#### Compilation

- Compile using the stable version of the Nim compiler. The 2.0 version is not out yet, but it is a good idea to compile against the development version of the compiler to check your implementation is reasonably future-proof.

#### Types

- Use the strictest types possible for the input, output and object fields. Prefer `Natural`, `Positive` or custom [subrange types](https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#types-subrange-types) to unconstrained `int` where applicable, use `Natural` for indexing.
- On the other hand, write generic code where appropriate. Do not impose arbitrary limitations if the code can work on a wider range of data types.
- Don't use unsigned numerical types (`uint` and its sized variants), unless wrapping behaviour or binary manipulation is required for the algorithm.
- Prefer the [`Option[T]`](https://nim-lang.org/docs/options.html) to encode an [optional value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_type) instead of using an invalid value (like the `-1` or an empty string `""`), unless it is critical for the algorithm. It may be also fitting if you are looking for the equivalent of "NULL" (default value for pointers)[^null].

#### Exceptions and side-effects

- Raise Nim exceptions (`ValueError`, etc.) on erroneous input values.
- Use [exception tracking](https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#effect-system-exception-tracking). Right after the module-level documentation, add a `{.push raises: [].}` module pragma. This enforces that all `func`s don't raise any exceptions. If they do raise at least one, list them all with the `raises` pragma after the return type and before the `=` sign like this: `func foo(bar: int) {.raises: [IOError].} =`.

#### Documentation, examples and tests

- It is incited to give a usage example after the module documentation and the `push raises` pragma in the top-level `runnableExamples` block.
- Use the [`std/unittest` module](https://nim-lang.org/docs/unittest.html) to test your program.
- We recommend using a `when isMainModule:` block to run tests. This block runs when the module is compiled as an executable. See the [minimal example](#minimal-example).

#### Other

- If you need a third-party module that is not in the file [third_party_modules.md](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Nim/blob/master/third_party_modules.md), please add it to that file as part of your submission.
- Use the export marker `*` to distinguish the functions of your user-facing [application programming interface (API)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) from the internal helper functions.

### Minimal example

```nim
## My Algorithm
##
## Description, explanation, recommendations, sources, links.
{.push raises: [].}

runnableExamples:
  echo myFunction("bla")

func myFunction*(s: string): string {.raises: [ValueError].} =
  ## Function documentation
  if s.len == 0:
    raise newException(ValueError, "Empty string")
  return s

when isMainModule:
  import std/unittest

  suite "A suite of tests":
    test "runs correctly":
      check myFunction("bla") == "bla"
    test "raises ValueError":
      expect(ValueError): discard myFunction("")

```

### Submissions Requirements

- Make sure the code compiles before submitting.
- Look up the name of your algorithm in other active repositories of [TheAlgorithms](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/), like [TheAlgorithms/Python](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python). By reusing the same name, your implementation will be appropriately grouped alongside other implementations on the [project's web site](https://the-algorithms.com/).
- Please help us keep our issue list small by adding fixes: Add the number of the issue you solved — even if only partially — to the commit message of your pull request.
- Use *snake_case* (words separated with an underscore `_`) for the filename.
- Try to fit your work into the existing directory structure as much as possible. Please open an issue first if you want to create a new subdirectory.
- Writing documentation, be concise and check your spelling and grammar.
- Add a corresponding explanation to [Algorithms-Explanation](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Algorithms-Explanation) (optional but recommended).
- Most importantly, **be consistent in the use of these guidelines**.

**Happy coding!**
